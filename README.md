## :thought_balloon: Idea

The site for the fictional Ningyo Ramen shop in Warsaw where users can get information about the place, see menu and make an order, read and leave reviews about the place, see the location of the ramen shop and other contact information.

## :dart: Main Goals

The project was made upon finishing â‰ˆ60% of React course and had the goal to structure & strengthen the knowledge of the more advanced concepts learned such as redux, react router, custom hooks and working with local storage, etc. The idea was to practice React fundamentals and more advanced features and start feeling more confident with them.

## :wrench: Technologies Used

1. React
2. React Router
3. Redux
4. CSS Modules
5. Local Storage

## :mag: Things to Improve

1. The further optimization and refactoring.
2. For the use of this project local storage was used to store cart, orders and reviews data for the purposes of saving trafic on cloud services like e.g. Firebase. However, the mentioned data could also be send to the cloud service or back-end.
